Socket.IO/WebSocket Connection Issue: Backend Action Required
============================================================

Symptoms (Frontend Console):
----------------------------
- Socket not initialized
- WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:5000/socket.io/...' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established.
- GET http://localhost:5000/socket.io/... 400 (Bad Request)

What's Happening:
-----------------
- The frontend is trying to connect to the backend's Socket.IO server at localhost:5000, but the connection is being rejected or not established.
- As a result, real-time features (chat, notifications, live updates) are not working.

What the Backend Needs to Check & Fix:
--------------------------------------
1. Is the backend server running and listening on port 5000?
   - The frontend expects the backend to be available at http://localhost:5000.

2. Is Socket.IO properly initialized and listening?
   - Example (Node.js/Express):
     const server = require('http').createServer(app);
     const io = require('socket.io')(server, {
       cors: {
         origin: "http://localhost:5173",
         methods: ["GET", "POST"]
       }
     });
     server.listen(5000, () => console.log('Server running on port 5000'));

3. Is CORS configured to allow connections from the frontend?
   - The backend must allow CORS from http://localhost:5173 (the frontend dev server).

4. Are the Socket.IO versions compatible?
   - Both frontend and backend should use compatible major versions (e.g., v4.x on both).

5. Is authentication required for socket connections?
   - If the backend expects a token or cookie, make sure the frontend is sending it and the backend is validating it correctly.

6. Check backend logs for handshake errors or CORS issues.
   - There may be more detailed error messages in the backend console.

Why This Matters:
-----------------
- Until this is fixed, users will not be able to use real-time features like chat or notifications.
- The rest of the app (static pages, HTTP requests) will still work.

What to Provide to the Backend Developer:
-----------------------------------------
- This summary.
- The exact error messages from the browser console.
- The frontend is running on localhost:5173 and expects to connect to the backend at localhost:5000.

If your backend partner needs more details, they can ask for:
- The frontend's Socket.IO client initialization code.
- The backend's Socket.IO and server setup code.
